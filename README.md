# Pathfinder
Protocol that allows scalable peer to peer connections
Needs to be able to localize nearby routers to a data cluster to send data to
has 7 geo bubbles of distance for routing
uses a hybrid routing protocol to do ip routing
has to have a unique flag that tells packets that this isdestined for the pathfinder network
if the data is meant for pathfinder network and can't go to pathfinder destination via network than must vpn to that network thorugh normal internet

needs a way to determine how much data has transmitted through a node
will pay out the miner on how much data was transmitted through that node
